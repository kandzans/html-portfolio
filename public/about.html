<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there, I'm Kristians Andzans, originally from Latvia but now deeply rooted in Finland for over 4.5 years. 
  My journey has been a tale of diverse experiences and constant evolution. With a background in social sciences, 
  I've embarked on a new chapter in my professional life, transitioning from roles in research and the public sector 
  to the dynamic realm of web development.Fueled by a passion for innovation and problem-solving, I'm dedicated to 
  mastering the digital craft, leveraging my academic foundation to thrive in this ever-evolving field.</p>


<p>Outside the digital landscape, you'll often find me in the kitchen, where my love for cooking comes to life. 
  As a chef in a retirement house in Helsinki, I find immense joy in creating culinary delights that not only 
  tantalize the taste buds but also foster meaningful connections with the residents I serve.  Cooking isn't just 
  a profession for me, it's a way to express creativity, share experiences, and bring people together around the table.</p>

  <p>In addition to my culinary and coding passions, I'm deeply immersed in the world of sports and language learning.
     Whether I'm hitting the gym, pushing my limits or diving into language studies, unlocking the doors to new cultures 
     and perspectives, I thrive on the challenges and discoveries that come with both pursuits. Sports teach me resilience, 
     teamwork, and determination, while language learning opens up avenues for connection  and understanding with people 
     from diverse backgrounds.</p>
